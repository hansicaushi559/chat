# chat

## About this project 
The Chat App is created with Firebase , React and some react
dependences. First you need to create an account and afterwards
you can log-in to your account. When youâ€™re currently logged in you
can see your profile and you can go to home page, and send a
message or photo to the direct chat with other registered users.
The Chat App has authentication, which is managed from Firebase
and stores the messages to Firestore. It is fully responsive for small
devices.
